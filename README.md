<h1> Look Twice as Much as You Say: Scene Graph Contrastive Learning for Self-Supervised Image Caption Generation Are scene graphs good enough to improve Image Captioning?</h1>

This is the PyTorch implementation of **Look Twice as Much as You Say: Scene Graph Contrastive Learning for Self-Supervised Image Caption Generation Are scene graphs good enough to improve Image Captioning?** traning code. 

We will continue to add more details and code to this repository as we go along. The configuration of this code can be referred to in the [butd-image-captioning
